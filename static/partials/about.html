      <p>I'm attempting to read data from a Starcraft 2 replay file and then do something interesting with the data. This is a work-n-progress and currently I'm only starting to get game events; not even that interesting of ones.</p>
       <p>I'm inspired sites like <a href="http://www.sc2ranks.com/">sc2ranks</a> or <a href="http://ggtracker.com">ggtracker</a> which much more impressive apps than this pathetic display but its an <a href="https://github.com/headwinds/sc2jsonhunt">open source project</a> and a sign of better things to come - can't get any worse.</p>
